title: Instrumentation of code without editing it to debug for the slowest part of script

<p>
Few days back I had a issue where a script was getting timed out, from logs it was successful, it took 2 hours rather than 10 mins as what I thought would be enough time for it to complete. That script was pretty old and was created to work without proper logging, it just outputted log messages to <code>stdout</code>.
</p>

<p>
Lets say that the script under discussion is <code>ManagementNodeBackup.sh</code>
</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/bash
echo "logging statement 1"
sleep 2
echo "logging statement 2"
sleep 2
echo "logging statement 3"
sleep 2
echo "logging statement 4"
</pre>
<p>
even though here I have wrote it as a bash script this method will work for any scripting language or a compiled binary file too.
</p>

<p>
Execution of the script may provide output like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ bash ManagementNodeBackup.sh 
logging statement 1
logging statement 2
logging statement 3
logging statement 4
</pre>

<p>
After I ran the script with the <b><i>decorated</i></b> caused it to output:
</p>
<pre class="example">
time bash -x ManagementNodeBackup.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | 
while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]
do
    echo `date +%s` " $line";
done 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee backup.log
</pre>

<p>
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ time bash -x ManagementNodeBackup.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | 
&gt; while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]
&gt; do
&gt;     echo `date +%s` " $line";
&gt; done 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee backup.log
1516711319  + echo 'logging statement 1'
1516711319  logging statement 1
1516711319  + sleep 2
1516711321  + echo 'logging statement 2'
1516711321  logging statement 2
1516711321  + sleep 2
1516711323  + echo 'logging statement 3'
1516711323  logging statement 3
1516711323  + sleep 2
1516711325  + echo 'logging statement 4'
1516711325  logging statement 4

real    0m6.016s
user    0m0.011s
sys     0m0.028s
</pre>


<p>
<span class="underline"><b>Explanation</b></span>:
</p>

<p>
Here I started by redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> in command execution like:
<code>command 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
</p>

<p>
Now for, every line which is outputted on <code>stdout</code> we are going to read the line in a small bash program (i.e. while loop) and <b>prepend</b> date to it and print, like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
command 2&gt;&amp;1 |
while IFS='' read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]
do
    echo `date +%s` " $line";
done
</pre>

<p>
Other two qualifiers, first command <code>time</code> and last construct <code>| tee</code> are just to add more information and capture the output into log file which can be shipped back from production environment for debugging.
